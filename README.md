# Test assignment
You need to make a small unity project. According to the condition of the task, a static GameModel class is given, which implements a prototype-sketch of a game model of a certain game. To connect it correctly, you need to add a GameModel.Update() call in the update of any MonoBehaviour in unity. No changes should be made to the logic of this class. According to the task, it is required to make up the interface screen and two windows in the project according to the layouts. Windows open by clicking on the buttons of the main screen. The visual state of the window must be consistent with the logic of the game model in the GameModel.
